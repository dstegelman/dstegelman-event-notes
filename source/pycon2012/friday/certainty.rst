**Presenter:** Geremy Condra

**Track:** I

**Description:**

    Nobody thinks you have to be a performance expert to write performance tests- why assume that you have to be a security expert to write security tests? During this presentation I'll show you how to use fuzzers, attack tools, and other simple techniques to help protect your users, improve the strength of your existing tests, and gain confidence in the security of your code. There will be demos!
