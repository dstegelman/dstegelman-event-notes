Django on Gevent
================

**Presenter:** Cody Soyland

**Track:** II

**Description:**

    This is an introduction to using the Gevent networking library to empower your Django application with realtime features and resource-efficient cooperative concurrency. Django's synchronous APIs make it impractical to use in a callback-based networking library, but fast single-threaded concurrency is still possible using the mind-blowing capabilities of coroutines.
