API Design Tips
===============

**Presenter:** Daniel Lindsley

**Track:** I

**Description:**

    The focus of this talk will be on some pragmatic tips on how to design programmatic (non-web-based) APIs for use by other developers.

What
----

* Not HTTP APIs
* Programmatic APIs
* Libraries

Why
---

* Other people use your code all the time
* You might be not happy with past you.

You cannot make everyone happy
------------------------------

* You make assumptions about your environment
* These don't always apply for other people
* More people are happy if they can extend libraries
* No copy-paste should be needed
* Good docs matter
* Real world use is the best use.

Design
------

* Bottom up
* Top down
* Bottom up sucks
* Top down feels better
* Everything fits together
* Less duplication
* Test Driven Design

Things you Should Do
--------------------

* Small components
* Reflection (To and From)  Be able to reverse operate
* Narrow Familiarity - How similar is the code itself.
* Assume the worst
