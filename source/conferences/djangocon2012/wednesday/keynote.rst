Fixing Computer Science
=======================

* Computer science enrollment has decreased
* 50% growth expected by 2018
* 70% of FOSS devs have at least a Bachelors degree

Open Source Lifestyle
---------------------

* Freedom
* Sharing
* Licensing
* Work/Learn/Teach

Teaching Someone How to Program
-------------------------------

* Mentoring
* Filesystem navigation
* Very confusing for new users GUI to Terminal
* Explain filesystems for BOTH GUI and Terminal
* New users get frustrated easily

Open Licensing of Materials
---------------------------

* Paris Declaration (http://bit.ly/MTvxzl)

How to Teach
------------

* Just challenging enough to be interesting, but not hard enough to be frustrating
* Modeling
* Guided practice
* Independent Practice
* Generalization

Lost 35% of CS courses in High Schools
--------------------------------------

* Other academic areas are represented in High Schools
* Shortage of teachers in areas where CS is desired
* Minorities are not represented
* Computer science seen as an elective
* Not a part of Math or Science

What we need to Teach
---------------------

* Computational Thinking
* Large gap between teachers and open source developers

Invite more people into Open Source
-----------------------------------

* Speak language of education
