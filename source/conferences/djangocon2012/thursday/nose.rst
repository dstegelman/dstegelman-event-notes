Django Nose
===========

**Presenter:** ERIK ROSE

**Track:** II

**Description:**

    Django's testrunner gets you started quickly, but you soon hit your head on its limitations as your project grows. By trading it for nose, a testing framework popular in the wider Python community, we can reduce boilerplate, boost performance, and improve testing UI, with only a few lines of setting changes. Re-use your test DBs, integrate with Jenkins, split your suite into pieces, and more.
