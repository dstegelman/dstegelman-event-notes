============================================

**Presenter:** JOSHUA "JAG" GINSBERG

**Track:** II

**Description:**

    This tutorial introduces Redis, an in-memory key-object NoSQL datastore. We discuss out-of-the-box ways Redis can help improve the performance of your Django deployments, ways that using Redis instead of SQL for some data management can accelerate your apps, and more advanced and unconventional uses for Redis to solve real-time and big-data problems.
