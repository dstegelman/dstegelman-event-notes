Python Performance Profiling
============================

**Presenter:** A. Jesse Jiryu Davis

**Track:** Track 1

**Description:**

    Your Python program is too slow, and you need to optimize it. Where do you start? With the right tools, you can optimize your code where it counts. We’ll explore the guts of the Python profiler “Yappi” to understand its features and limitations. We’ll learn how to find the maximum performance wins with minimum effort.
