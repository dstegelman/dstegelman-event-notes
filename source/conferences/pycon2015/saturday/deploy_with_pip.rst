=============================
Ship It: Deployments with PIP
=============================

**Presenter:** Dan Tracy

**Track:** Track 2

**Description:**

    Gone are the days where creating system packages or scp-ing tar balls were required for deployment. With Pip, Fabric, and Jenkins we've developed a pipeline to simplify deployments and rollbacks that dove-tails into configuration management and virtualization. New machines can come fully deployed and ready to rock at a moments notice allowing you to scale out nodes quickly and painlessly.
