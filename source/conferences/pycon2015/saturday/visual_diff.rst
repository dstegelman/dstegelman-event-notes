===========================================
Make Web Dev awesome with visual diff tools
===========================================

**Presenter:** Daniel Vanderkam

**Track:** Track 3

**Description:**

    Visual diffs are a great way to check for regressions on web sites which may be missed by unit tests. In this talk you'll learn how to run end-to-end tests on your client and server web libraries using a tool called dpxdt. I'll also show how you can combine it with web-based diff tools like "git webdiff" to quickly and confidently iterate on web tools.
