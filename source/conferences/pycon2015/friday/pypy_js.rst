========================
PyPy.js: What? How? Why?
========================

**Presenter:** Ryan Kelly

**Track:** Track 2

**Description:**

    PyPy.js is an experiment in building a fast and compliant in-browser python interpreter, by compiling PyPy into javascript and retargeting its JIT to emit javascript code at runtime. This talk will demonstrate the combination of technologies that make such a thing possible, the results achieved so far, and the challenges that still remain when taking python onto javascript's home turf.
