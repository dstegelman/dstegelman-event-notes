Appeal for Loose Coupling
=========================

**Presenter:** Augie Fackler, Nathaniel Manista

**Track:** Track 2

**Description:**

    Great software is made out of cooperating independent modules; unusable, incorrect, and bad software happen when modules don’t (or can’t) work together. What makes modules friendly or hostile? How do abusive relationships between modules happen? How can we write code that creates and maintains healthy connections to other code?
