**Description:**

	In an ideal world, every web system would provide a well designed REST API with oAuth authentication. But what do you do when those things don't exist?


Guerilla APIs
-------------

* Big companies do not embrace API centric development
* In order to get this data you have to use unconventional tactics.
* Can build user facing API that works how we want to
* Not productized (but could be)

RSS handling
============

* FeedParser
* Time tasks/cron to retrieve content
* Pythonic interface for RSS handling

Email Handling
==============

* Get pure text
* HTML
* Attachments
* Emails may be recursive
* Mimetype
* DOCX
* DOC

PDF Processing
==============

* PDF is a printing format
* Internally, vector based drawing instructions
* May contain attachments
* PDFMiner
* Some PDFs are locked down

Use Selenium to open a browser session to actually submit forms programatically.
