Small Shop/Big Solutions
========================

**Presenter:** Ben Keating

**Track:** I

**Description:**

	In a small non-profit with a 10,000 year business plan, how does todays technology play a role? how does it hold up against entropy and evolve over long-periods of time? Django has done very well for us and I'd like to share some of my stories and lessons. A small shop can build big solutions that last.
