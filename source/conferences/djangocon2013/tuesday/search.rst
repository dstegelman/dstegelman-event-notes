Finding The Needle: Search and Django
=====================================

**Presenter:** Ben Lopatin

**Track:** II

**Description:**

	Most websites share at least two things in common: content and users who want to find content. This talk will cover the basics of site search using search engines (the kind you run, not Google), setting up a Django project with Haystack, highlight some of the gotchas you might encounter, and touch on some more advanced functionality.
