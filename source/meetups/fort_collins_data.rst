Investigating Data with Python
==============================

**Presenter:** Mike Cullerton


**Description:**

Data Mining. Data Scientist. Data Center. Everywhere you look, data is front and center these days.

Python has a growing data analysis community, and some of the best tools available on any platform. With its ease of use, and ability to solve even the largest problems, Python is quickly becoming the language of choice for data analytics.

This month Mike Cullerton will help us investigate some of the most popular Python tools for working with relational data. We'll discuss what we mean by relational data, introduce the SQLAlchemy object relational mapper for working with SQL databases, and munge some of our own data using the Pandas data analysis toolkit.

Bring your laptop and follow along, or bring a data question and we'll try to answer them.

Thank you to the Digital Workshop Center for sponsoring our meetup and providing our meeting space.
