Introduction
============


* Static vs Dynamically typed language.
* Compiler must now ahead of time what type an object is
* In python you do not have to do that, because is not a static type language
* Type is checked at run time, not typed at compile time.  It is a dynamic language
* Compiler allocates memory.
* In python creates types and assigns names to them (not variables)
** these are references to other objects not actual objects themselves.
* Names are implemented like ditionaries
