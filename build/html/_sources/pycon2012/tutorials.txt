Introduction
============

* Static vs Dynamically typed language.
* Compiler must now ahead of time what type an object is
* In python you do not have to do that, because is not a static type language
* Type is checked at run time, not typed at compile time.  It is a dynamic language
* Compiler allocates memory.
* In python creates types and assigns names to them (not variables)

** These are references to other objects not actual objects themselves.
* Names are implemented like ditionaries


Dictionaries and Namespaces
===========================

Python Objects and Vars
-----------------------

*Things like a = 17 are essentially dictionaries.  These are added to ``object land``.
* Python object has:
** Single value
** Single Type
** some number of attributes
** single ID
** zero or one or more names in one or more namespaces
** one or more base classes
