Interfaces and Python
=====================

**Presenter:** Eric Snow

**Track:** IV

**Description:**

    In 2.6, Python introduced the Abstract Base Classes. Before that we had "protocols" (and we still do). In this talk we'll look at how the general concept of interfaces fits into today's Python. We'll also look at some of the alternate proposals of the past, some of the controversies around ABCs, and the direction interfaces might go in the future.
