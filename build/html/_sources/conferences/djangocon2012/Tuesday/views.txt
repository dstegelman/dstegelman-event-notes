===================
Views Can Be Classy
===================

**Presenter:** Kenneth Love

**Track:** II

**Description:**

    An overview of what class-based views (CBVs) are, which ones are available, and how to use them in your projects. I'll also cover creating mixins, where function-based views still make sense, and how to test CBVs. As part of this, I'll be covering my django-braces (https://crate.io/packages/django-braces/) package.
