====================
Stop Writing Classes
====================


Classes are overused
====================

* Obfuscated function calls
* Classes with an __init__ and one other method.
* SHouldn't instantiate use them once, and then throw them away.
* Namespaces are there to help and prevent naming collisions.
* Containers are great use case for classes.


Exceptions
==========

* Don't make new exceptions, you don't need to.
